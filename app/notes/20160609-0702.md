I was trying to tune a PostgreSQL database and found that default
settings for PostgreSQL are optimized for really old computers.  If you want to
fix it, you can spend an hour reading through documentation, or you can use
[pgtune](https://github.com/gregs1104/pgtune).  If CLI isn't your
thing, you can try the [web version](http://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/).
