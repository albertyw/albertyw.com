Eva Air USB Ports

I just got off an Eva Air flight which had in-seat USB ports not only for power
but also for data.  I found that when I plugged in USB keys, it could navigate
through FAT32 and NTFS memory sticks which makes me think that the in-flight
entertainment system was based off of an embedded Windows OS.  Several of the
games in the system also had multiplayer modes which would mean that there
must be some LAN within the plane and since the plane's audio announcement
system could pipe audio through the seatback system, that must be connected
as well.

Although I doubt the Boeing 777's designers would also link up flight-critical
systems like avionics, there is something to be said about the possibilities
arising from putting some sufficiently determined hacker on a plane
with Wi-Fi, an electrical socket, physical access to a Windows-backed
USB port, and twelve-plus hours of boredom.

In-seat USB Port

If you are traveling on our selected B777-300ER (Royal Laurel Class) and A330-300 aircrafts (Premium Laurel Class), you can navigate through PDF files, photos and other multimedia content stored in your storage devices (iPod, USB flash drive**, AV connector-enabled device, etc.) on your seat-back screen. Instructions are shown on the screen once connected.
