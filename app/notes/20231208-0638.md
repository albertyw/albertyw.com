Setup.py is more or less deprecated and should be replaced by alternatives like pyproject.toml or poetry.  This requires installing a few dependencies:

```bash
pip install build twine
```

| setup.py command     | alternative command |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| setup.py sdist       | python -m build     |
| setup.py bdist_wheel | python -m build     |
| setup.py test        | python -m unittest  |
| setup.py install     | pip install         |
| setup.py develop     | pip install -e      |
| setup.py upload      | twine upload        |
| setup.py check       | twine check         |
