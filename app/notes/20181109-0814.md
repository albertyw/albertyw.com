My first server's IP

As a freshman at MIT I decided that it would be a fun way to get a head
start on my CS classes by setting up a webserver and playing around with
![ubuntu](/static/notes/20181109-0814.png).  As I learned later, a typical
MIT Course 6 curriculum doesn't care much for practical devops abilities
(more on that subject for a later note), but I still remember the IP address
that was first allocated to me for setting up my server at albertyw.mit.edu -
`18.239.1.127`.

I noticed recently that MIT sold off large portions of its `18.0.0.0/8` class A
IP address range, which included the entire `18.239.0.0/16` range including my
old IP address.  I assume that the sold IP addresses will be made available
randmoly as part of AWS's Elastic IP Addresses pool for people to attach to
AWS hosts and and expose to the wider internet.  While `18.239.1.127` still
seems unallocated, I wish best of luck to whoever gets the IP address (unless
I happen to grab it first).
