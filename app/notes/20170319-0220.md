Projects: Git-Browse

git-browse

I've recently worked on a project called Git-Browse to help look up information
in [github](https://github.com/albertyw) and uber's [phabricator](https://www.phacility.com/).
Quite often, I've found the need to look up information about a git repository
in order to share code with people, find history, or file issues.  Having to
manually look up the repository on github or phabricator takes excessive time
and can easily lead to incorrect information from looking at forks.  Git-Browse
solves the problem by introspecting a git repository's `.git/config` file
and automatically opening the git repository in a browser.  Git-Browse can then
be integrated in your local or global `.gitconfig` as an alias so you can open
repository objects with `git browse <path>`.

While working on git-browse, I found that this is similar to
[github hub's browse](https://github.com/github/hub/blob/fe5b59b5489f2ac647c51914bf8e1b0e9993451f/commands/browse.go)
but git-browse would be a lot easier to support additional repository hosts.
Hub doesn't support opening arbitrary branches or commits either, but it does
support opening issues and wikis.

Git-Browse requires python 3 to run.  Install it by following the
[Readme Instructions](https://github.com/albertyw/git-browse/blob/master/README.md#installation).
