Map Caps Lock to Escape for Vim

As an avid vim user (better than emacs!), I'm having to escape out of different
modes pretty often.  Hitting the escape button on most keyboards adds a lot of
friction being pretty far away from home row on a keyboard (not to mention
simply missing on some versions of Macbooks).  I've therefore remapped caps
lock to escape to make it much easier to work with Vim.

For a mac, this is pretty easy and is built directly into MacOS.  Within System
Preferences -> Keyboard, you can edit Modifier Keys and remap Caps Lock to
Escape.
