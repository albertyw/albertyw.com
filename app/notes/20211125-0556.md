As an avid vim user (better than emacs!), I'm having to escape out of different
modes pretty often.  Hitting the escape button on most keyboards adds a lot of
friction being pretty far away from home row on a keyboard (not to mention
simply missing on some versions of Macbooks).  I've therefore remapped caps
lock to escape to make it much easier to work with Vim.

For a mac, this is pretty easy and is built directly into MacOS.  Within System
Preferences -> Keyboard, you can edit Modifier Keys and remap Caps Lock to
Escape.
