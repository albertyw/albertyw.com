There's a famous saying "Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM".  This once
referred to IBM being a huge ubiquitous company that was a safe choice for
being a technology vendor.  Nowadays, though IBM is still a pretty large
company (#42 on the Fortune 500), it's outshined by newer larger tech companies
like Facebook (#34), Apple (#3), Amazon (#2), Netflix (#115), and Google (#9).
These FAANG companies share similar culture and technology and are frequently
copied by other companies on things like interview process, internal tools, UX
design, and compensation.  I therefore propose that the 2020 version of this
saying is "Nobody ever got fired for copying FAANG."
