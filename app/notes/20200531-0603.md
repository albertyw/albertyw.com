On switching from Go's `dep` tool to `mod`:

- `dep ensure` turns into `go mod download`
- `dep ensure -update` turns into `go-mod-upgrade` with the [go-mod-upgrade](https://github.com/oligot/go-mod-upgrade) tool
- `dep check` turns into `go mod verify`
- `Gopkg.toml` turns into `go.mod`
- `Gopkg.lock` turns into `go.sum`
