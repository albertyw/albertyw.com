A PID controller is a common systems control function based on a feedback loop.
PID stands for:

- Proportional: A multiplier on the error between the measured and set/target value.  This effect increases the farther the output is from the target (error).
- Integral: A multiplier on the accumulated error over time.  This effect increases the more time (and error) the output is from the target.
- Derivative: A multiplier on the rate of change of error.  This is meant to dampen oscillations.

Below is an example chart that shows a PID controller in a system where the target is "10", the starting value is "0", and with a variety of PID tuple configurations.
