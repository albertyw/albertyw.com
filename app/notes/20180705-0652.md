Some MIT (Undergraduate) Admissions Interview Advice

I've been doing MIT admissions interviews for two years now and I'm planning
on doing a third this Fall.  So far, I've had a fun time talking to about 15
high school seniors about their interests and college plans.  I've noticed a
few common themes in interviews:

1. Students are pretty reticent.  Although nervousness is certainly a
contributing factor here, it's hard to have an interesting one sided
conversation.
2. Students say they have interests in some subject area but when asked to go
deeper, to explain what about an area interests them, or how they've scratched
their interests by investing time learning about their interests, they don't
have many examples.  Of course, not everyone is afforded opportunities that match
their interests, and it's much easier to demonstrate interest in something like
computer science than nuclear engineering.  However, saying that one is
interested in something but not doing anything about it doesn't give much
credence to the former.
3. Many students concentrate too hard on either just academics or have
participated in way too many extracurriculars.  Either way, both extremes
limit real exposure to different ways of thinking and as a side effect creates
pretty cookie cutter stories during interviews.
