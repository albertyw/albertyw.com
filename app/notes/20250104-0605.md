Javascript/Typescript Decorators Suck

I just spent a few days looking into implementing Javascript/Typescript decorators into a
library and have come to the conclusion that the languages' implementations are too poorly
supported to be distributed in shared libraries.

There seems to be multiple incompatible decorator implementations including:

1. An ES2016 decorator of the type `function decorator(target, key, descriptor)`
2. A [Typescript 4 decorator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html)
   of the type `function decorator(target, key, descriptor)`
   which seems to be mostly the same as in ES2016 but still requires a
   `"experimentalDecorators": true` to be set in `tsconfig.json`
3.  And a [Typescript 5 decorator](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0/#decorators)
    of the type `function decorator(originalMethod: Function, context: DecoratorContext): Function`

All three decorator patterns work by declaring `@decorator` in front of the class, method, or property to be decoratored.
All three decorator patterns do not work on bare functions.
The first two have also been deemed "experimental" for years (ES2016 has been around for a decade) and are backwards
incompatible with the currently supported decorator pattern in Typescript (not backported to ECMAScript) and therefore
are also poorly supported by compilers like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators) and
various munging tools like webpack.

It's therefore pretty much impossible for a shared library to use decorators without
resorting to shipping multiple decorator implementations (e.g. a `@decorateES2016` as well as `@decorateTypescript5`) or
having janky instructions like adding flags to node packages' `tsconfig.json`.

I guess Javascript is still catching up to Python which has had [decorators](https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/) for 20+ years now.
