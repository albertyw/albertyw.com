I have a particular interest in multicolor pens and I've developed a taste for
them over the years since using the common [BIC 4-Color Ballpoint Pen](https://www.amazon.com/BIC-4-Color-Medium-Assorted-3-Count/dp/B002JFR8Q8/).
Those pens only have four basic colors, and the actual tips and ink result in
inconsistent sticky ink flow.  BIC also makes 4-Color pens with finer points
but that only results in spotty writing.

Next up, I've also used the [Zebra Multi Color Pen](https://www.amazon.com/Zebra-Clip-Multifunctional-Barrel-B4SA1-W/dp/B0018RJK0U/)
which is a similar pen but with an additional pencil included.  The ink and
ballpoint is also slightly better than the BIC.

For those who optimize for options, there's [6 color](https://www.amazon.com/KitMax-Multicolor-Ballpoint-Supplies-Students/dp/B016T77Q7C/)
and [10 color](https://www.amazon.com/Fun-Express-Plastic-Shuttle-1-Pack/dp/B00O73T5B6/)
pens.  If the ridiculousness of the number of colors doesn't keep you from
using the pens every day, the problem with having so many colors is that their
individual ink sticks are more off-center.  This causes more bending of the ink
and can make the side of a ballpoint pen scrape along paper.  It also makes
writing more spongy because of the increased room and bent existent within the
pen.

The pen that I use now is the [Uni Jetstream Pen](https://www.amazon.com/Uni-Jetstream-Function-Ballpoint-MSXE510007-24/dp/B002CKJ4VC/).
It contains the four standard black, red, green, and blue colors, plus a
pencil and eraser.  It has some reasonable weight, the writing is
consistent, and it looks pretty professional.
