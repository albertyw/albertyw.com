I recently got a new 2021 Apple Macbook Pro 14" with the M1 Pro processor
(quite a nice upgrade from my previous 2014 Macbook Pro).  While the fact that
the new ports on the 2021 Macbook Pro are great, the biggest hangup was
switching from an AMD64 to an ARM64 CPU.  For my development workflow, this
meant switching to ARM64 versions of developer tools or switching to entirely
different tools altogether.  Following is an abridged list of dev tools that I
use and what I switched to on ARM64.

|AMD64 tool | New tool |
|------------|----------|
| Python     | Works great |
| Node       | Works great |
| Go         | Works great |
| Desktop apps (Chrome, iTerm, Slack, etc) | No issues found |
| [Factorio](https://factorio.com/) | Works great |
| Virtualbox | [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) |
| Docker | Works great |
| Phantomjs | Chromium |
| [Official MySQL Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) | [Semi-Official MySQL Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mysql/mysql-server) |
| Hadolint | [No alternative so far](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/issues/411) |
| Syncthing | Works great |
| MenuMeters | Works great |
| Amphetamine | Works great |

So far with few minor hickups, transitioning from AMD64 to ARM64 is working
pretty well.  Even transitioning off Virtualbox to a different Virtual Machine
(UTM/QEMU) platform seemed pretty flawless.
