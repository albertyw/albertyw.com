I've noticed that many companies have yearly revenues on the order of many
(non-insignificant countries).  With countries though, yearly revenues are
usually called gross domestic product (GDP).  I therefore present a comparison
of national revenues and corporate GDPs:

| Company? | Rank within type | GDP (billions of USD) | Name              |
|:--------:|:----------------:|:---------------------:|:------------------|

headquartered in Switzerland, which has a GDP of $652B.
