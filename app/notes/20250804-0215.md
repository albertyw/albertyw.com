A list of practical topics to learn as an introduction to computer science and beginner software engineering:

- [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/introduction-to-data-structures/) ([textbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms)), emphasis on the data structures such as arrays, maps, and graphs
- Programming languages to learn well:
    - SQL (everyone uses SQL)
    - Python (or some scripting language)
    - Typescript (for a well-implemented but accessible strongly-typed language)
    - Go (for a simple language with good support for parallelization)
- Programming languages to learn:
    - C (the fount of current languages)
    - Java (the most common language for backend engineering)
    - Javascript (the Lingua Franca for frontend engineering)
    - HTML (because you're sooner or later going to need to build a website)
    - Bash (so you can improve your tools)
- How to learn a language: write small programs for it in [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=algorithmic-heights), [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), or similar
- Topics to go deeper on:
    - [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) - a dive into architecture around storage, indexing, and processing of data
    - [Code architecture](https://aosabook.org/en/index.html) - Learn how to break software down into modules with abstractions
    - [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/) - some rules for designing backend systems
    - Unix/Linux basics - environment variables, everything is file
    - [HTTP](https://www.syncfusion.com/succinctly-free-ebooks/http)/[JSON](http://json.org/) - how to send messages between systems like they're websites
    - [gRPC](https://github.com/akshayjshah/grpc-demystified)/[Proto](https://protobuf.dev/) - how to send messages between systems (grown up)
- [Tooling](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/):
    - Text editor and/or IDE - know and/or configure the capabilities of your text editor or terminal environment
    - Terminal - Learn CLI commands as you need them but be familiar with things like piping data from one command to another
    - [Git](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Version control everything.  Be familiar with rebase.
    - (Optional) Set up and configure your [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/).  Once you start version controlling your configuration, you'll more actively customize your working environment
