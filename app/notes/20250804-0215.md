A list of practical topics to learn as an introduction to computer science and beginner software engineering:

- [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/introduction-to-data-structures/) ([textbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms)) - the basics of computer science; emphasis on the data structures such as arrays, maps, and graphs
- Programming languages to learn well:
   - Python (or some scripting language)
   - Typescript (for a well-implemented but accessible strongly-typed language)
   - Go (for a simple language with good support for parallelization)
   - SQL (widely applicable for talking to databases)
- Programming languages to learn:
   - C (the fount of current languages)
   - Java (the most common language for backend engineering)
   - Javascript (the Lingua Franca for frontend engineering)
   - HTML (because you're sooner or later going to need to build a website)
   - Bash (so you can improve your tools)
- How to learn a language: write small programs for it in [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=algorithmic-heights), [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), or similar to learn the syntax.  Write small projects in it to learn the language ecosystem.
- Topics to go deeper on:
   - Unix/Linux basics - Environment variables, everything is a file
   - [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/) - Some rules for designing backend systems
   - [HTTP](https://www.syncfusion.com/succinctly-free-ebooks/http)/[JSON](http://json.org/) - How to send messages between systems like they're websites
   - [gRPC](https://github.com/akshayjshah/grpc-demystified)/[Proto](https://protobuf.dev/) - How to send messages between systems (grown up)
   - [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) - A dive into architecture around storage, indexing, and processing of data
   - [Code architecture](https://aosabook.org/en/index.html) - Learn how to break software down into modules with abstractions
- [Tooling](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/):
   - IDE and/or Text editor (try [Neovim](https://neovim.io/doc/user/intro.html)) - Know and/or configure the capabilities of your text editor or terminal environment
   - Terminal - Learn CLI commands as you need them but be familiar with things like piping data from one command to another
   - [Git](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Version control everything.  Be familiar with rebase.
   - (Optional) Set up and configure your [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) - Once you start version controlling your configuration, you'll more actively customize your working environment
- Projects (because building things is more fun than reading)
   - Build a static website
   - Build a web scraper
   - Build a CLI
   - Build a program that reads/writes data to a database
   - Build a program that reads, processes, and writes data to a file
