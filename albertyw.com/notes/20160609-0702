"note": "I was trying to tune a PostgreSQL database and found that default
settings for PostgreSQL are optimized for really old computers.  If you want to

<a href=\"https://github.com/gregs1104/pgtune\">pgtune</a>.  If CLI isn't your
thing, you can try the <a href=\"http://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/\">web version</a>.",
